((The word Coordinate means the position of the chess piece in the chess board in terms of row and column ! ))

First of all the main logic is tracking the chess pieces 

All chess pieces are being tracked by the class ChessPieceDictionary. 
Remember this class store all the initial positions as well the names of the chess piece in a dictionary.

Then we use this dictionary in a variety of ways 

Our logic starts in GAMEMANAGER script

It first raycast and check if the mouse is over a chess piece.
If it is then it gets the chess piece name and then it will send the name as well as it's coordinates to selectedChessPiece function

Then this function will run and in a switch case this function will send the coordinates of chess piece and the type of function to be used in ChessPiece class


Our chessPiece class is the HERO ! 

It gets the coordinates and then it's function will run and will do complex calculations to find all possible moves 
This all possible moves will be stored in a list ! 

Then it will return it to our selectedChessPiece function

Chess piece class also note down all the 

After that HighlightChessPiece will highlight the available positions as well as if there is enemy then  it will red them
